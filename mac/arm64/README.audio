We use a custom build of mpv on arm64:

- brew uninstall mpv; brew install mpv.rb
- bash copy-audio.sh
- confirm minos is 11 in dist/audio: for f in mpv lame libs/*; do otool -l $f | grep minos; done

Changes in mpv.rb:
- disabled lua and javascript
- disabled vapoursynth, which has a Python dependency
- set deployment target
